# Deep-fake-memes-with-First-Order-Motion-Model-for-Image-Animation

Aliaksandr Siarohin, Stéphane Lathuilière, Sergey Tulyakov, Elisa Ricci and Nicu Sebe did an amazing, simply phenomenal work called the "First Order Motion Model for Image Animation". Their technology allows you to read facial expressions and movements from video and supplement the static image on the basis of this, predicting what parts that are not in the original image will look like. It looks like magic, so let's make memes!
